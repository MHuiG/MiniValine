Only one occasion now.  An end match that was\n      triggered but could not be completed.  When might this happen?  When an `endSameasBegin`\n      rule sets the end rule to a specific match.  Since the overall mode termination rule that's\n      being used to scan the text isn't recompiled that means that any match that LOOKS like\n      the end (but is not, because it is not an exact match to the beginning) will\n      end up here.  A definite end match, but when `doEndMatch` tries to \"reapply\"\n      the end rule and fails to match, we wind up here, and just silently ignore the end.\n\n      This causes no real harm other than stopping a few times too many.\n      */\n\n      mode_buffer += lexeme;\n      return lexeme.length;\n    }\n\n    var language = getLanguage(languageName);\n    if (!language) {\n      console.error(LANGUAGE_NOT_FOUND.replace(\"{}\", languageName));\n      throw new Error('Unknown language: \"' + languageName + '\"');\n    }\n\n    compileLanguage(language);\n    var top = continuation || language;\n    var continuations = {}; // keep continuations for sub-languages\n    var result = '', current;\n    for(current = top; current !== language; current = current.parent) {\n      if (current.className) {\n        result = buildSpan(current.className, '', true) + result;\n      }\n    }\n    var mode_buffer = '';\n    var relevance = 0;\n    try {\n      var match, count, index = 0;\n      while (true) {\n        top.terminators.lastIndex = index;\n        match = top.terminators.exec(codeToHighlight);\n        if (!match)\n          break;\n        count = processLexeme(codeToHighlight.substring(index, match.index), match);\n        index = match.index + count;\n      }\n      processLexeme(codeToHighlight.substr(index));\n      for(current = top; current.parent; current = current.parent) { // close dangling modes\n        if (current.className) {\n          result += spanEndTag;\n        }\n      }\n      return {\n        relevance: relevance,\n        value: result,\n        illegal:false,\n        language: languageName,\n        top: top\n      };\n    } catch (err) {\n      if (err.message && err.message.indexOf('Illegal') !== -1) {\n        return {\n          illegal: true,\n          relevance: 0,\n          value: escape(codeToHighlight)\n        };\n      } else if (SAFE_MODE) {\n        return {\n          relevance: 0,\n          value: escape(codeToHighlight),\n          language: languageName,\n          top: top,\n          errorRaised: err\n        };\n      } else {\n        throw err;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  /*\n  Highlighting with language detection.
